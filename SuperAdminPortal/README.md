Homemade bomb-timer attached to 10kilos of C-4, wouldn't it be cool?

Of course not. There are many problems that engineers could solve in our
country before they start supplying DIY explosive devices.
e.g Our national services personals haven been complaining about bad network services
from their various locations outside Accra and these problems have been around
for many years. Only the major cities in Ghana have good cell service
So why isn't any one working on that, most of our engineers can build portable 
low budget signal boosters and market it exclusively as travel supply kit but they are
too busy chasing bugs in their codes. 

A much more helpful way the developers in Ghana can help us is by building
a faster and cheaper internet service for us. Internet data charges in Ghana
is outrageous to say the least. The average Ghanaian spends no less than 300 GhC(50 usd)
a week on internet bills. The internet has given third world countries
an even playground to contribute their quota on a global scale and yet Ghanaians have
to pay so much to be on the internet. I wish I could put a team together to 
seriously work on providing a super fast yet cheaper internet service in Ghana.

Anyways the device in this video is not a bomb, its a seven segment display board
repurposed for managing queues in banks, shops, bus stations, etc. Not every POS
can be accessed through a screen, sometimes customers have to walk to the place of
business to resolve their issues. The ideal implementation would be to place 
the device outside, then the customers are given tickets with numbers on it,
 the customer's ticket number is displayed on the device to alert them its turn to be serviced
This can ensure convid19 rules of spacing are enforced since the customers don't
 have to necessarily stand in a long queue next to each other.
This is not an invention, the idea was inspired by visiting a kfc joint.
What makes this different is it can be engineered to work with another application through an API,
a simple POS running or a desktop or tablet can hit device's API routes asynchronously
to manage the queue in the shop.
